# cv-static-site
This project uses [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org) with
[Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com) to build a static site for my cv.

## Hosting
The static site built is deployed to and hosted on s3 using Terraform
and can be accessed at <https://cv.bernardting.com>. The infrastructure
surrounding the routing to that domain name is handled in
<https://github.com/benating/cloud-resume-challenge>.
